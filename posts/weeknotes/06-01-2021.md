###Read

- Finished reading [*2034: A Novel of the Next World War*
](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54211065-2034). A nice blend of what could happen in the future sprinkled in with how this has already happened many times over in history. If you have anxiety about "current affairs" probably give it a miss.

- Finished Reading [*Dune*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune). I saw the movie trailer and felt like this is one of those books I should have read, so I did. Like all good sci-fi, this is pretty timeless. Definitely, not written with any female perspective whatsoever but not sure you can expect much from something written in 1965. I don't plan to read the rest of the series.
