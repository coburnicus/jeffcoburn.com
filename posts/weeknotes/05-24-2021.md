Like [Alice](https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes), [Dan](https://danmall.com/weeknotes/2021-05-23/), and [Joe](https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog/1), I'm would like to make this a thing.

###[Computers]

- Built a [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) site with a [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) backend. So far I'm happy with the improvements from using [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org) (not [netlify](https://www.netlify.com) the deployment service, which is one of the most brilliant products released in the last decade. Creating a custom content type, and adding an editor was pretty painless. I've been using Jekyll for almost a decade, but keeping a ruby stack running along side my javascript stuff has gotten to be too much of an ass-ache.

- Watched some of [Build 2021](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/home), Microsoft's developer conference. We are, of course, very post-the-time-things-made-any-sense, but it still feels weird the Microsoft is eating everybody's lunch when it comes to supporting a development community.

- Tried to build something that seems doable in [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/s/), but so far it's Fail City, might take another shot at it this week.  

###[Home Life]

- Getting W some home with his social/emotional skills. This has been an unkind year for him.

- Planted some grass. I hate landscaping and abhor competing with neighbors, but my yards is just a pile of dirt where chipmunks dwell. I went with with a hardy grass that has clover mixed in. Clover is not in style this century, but it appeals to me in that: it grows, it's green, and when you mow it, the clippings are nitrate (food) for the grass it is mixed in with.

###[Consumed]
- Finished season 2 of "For All Mankind." Herself and I are both really into it.

- Watch the first few episodes of Season 2 of Mythic Quest. I really really loved the two eps they did while in quarantine, but this season is really drilling down on how flawed the characters are. Much more of a "Always Sunny" vibe, which doesn't really fit with what I want right now.

- Watched "Master of None" Season 3. Very very different from the first two seasons. It was well done, but removing the Dev character was pretty predictable way to handle Aziz's own fall from grace.
