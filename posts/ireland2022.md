#Pre Launch

We got this trip off to a weird start because we booked the trip in January (before the huge price jump/gouge. Yeah!) for the weekend after the kids school let out, but then they had four more snow days and therefore we missed the last four school days. It seemed like they missed a bunch of movies and field days so it was probably fine. Thankfully, it seems we are the only people on the planet who flew to and from a destination and had no delays or lost luggage. I would not push my luck and try that again, for the time being. We also flew on Aer Lingus, which is a million times better than last time when we flew Norwegian Airlines. Norwegian decided that our flight would leave from a different city (Providence RI, not Boston) and land in a different city (Dublin, not Shannon) and the trip would happen on a different day. I try to go with the flow, but that was a lot.


#Week 1

The whole reason we can do this trip is Herself's folks have an apartment and car in Killarney Ireland. Our trip would be about 2 days long if we had to pay for hotels and car rentals. This trip was different because Herself's sister (twin, ie Spare Parts) has relocated back to Ireland and is getting set up with her new life, so therefore is living in said apartment, driving said car. It is great to send time with her, and the boys eat up any time they get with her. It was a flashback to the days when she often lived with us in some cramped apartment outside of Boston. 

I spent the first week commuting with La Twin to the next town over, Tralee, where she works at the university. I found a co-working space downtown that was very accommodating. Being a long time remote worker (a decade +), it's always a nice change of pace to work in an office, talk to folks, get tasty lunches out. Tralee is a really neat irish city, much less touristy than Killarney. I didn't make any new BFFs, like I did last trip (love you, Declan).
