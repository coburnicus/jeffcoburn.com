One of the concepts that was transmitted on repeat over the past decade is the idea of social media forming bubbles where you only see political/cultural content that already jives with what you already believe. Surely that is true, but you still shared the same platform with people who you might wildly disagree with, even if they only content you might have seen was fodder for lolz.

I have a hunch that as FB and Twitter start have a bit of an exodus, people seem to be replacing them with platforms that entirely jive with their general world view. I'm not drawing any equivalency between Mastodon and TruthParlorBagofShit, but it does seem that as we choose platforms we are choosing sides.
