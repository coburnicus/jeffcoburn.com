Today I was at the shop picking up some beverages for this evening. The two people in front of me bought PowerBall tickets. 
<blockquote>
Me: Did anybody win the PowerBall yet?

Her: Nope, it's a record high.

Me: I'm game.

Her: So 10 or 20 tickets?

Me: ...Just one.

Tonight I went around the table and asked everybody what the <i>first</i> thing you would buy with the money.
<blockquote>
Herself: Pay off the house.

R(7): Go to a water park...for a month!

W(10): Give it to charity
</blockquote>
For the record I would pay off the house and then take R & W to a water park for a month.
