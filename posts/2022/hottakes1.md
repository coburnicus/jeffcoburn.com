    <li>Mythic Quest is a better show than Ted Lasso. "Quarantine", "Everlight" and flashback episodes like "A Dark Quiet Death" and "Backstory!" don't get the love they deserve.</li>
    <li>Microsoft Outlook for the Web is a better product than Gmail. Just as good interface and keyboard shortcuts, more robust extension support and Power Automate makes it killer.</li>
    <li>Light VS Code themes are superior to dark themes. I am old.</li>
