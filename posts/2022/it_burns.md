Herself, returned from a trip to the University she is employed by, handed me a pack of strange candy. 

> "I got you this. I was in line at the campus store and every single kid in front of me grabbed a pack of this at the register. I know you love to keep up with what the kids are into."

I thought about nothing else since. Was it a generous, thoughtful act? Was it the the sickest of sick burns? I feel like this could literally trigger my impeding mid-life crisis.
