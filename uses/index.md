## HARDWARE
**Computer** - I have a honking M1-PRO 16" MacBook Pro with 32gb RAM. It is waaaay more than I need to fiddle with text, but I make my computers last (got 7 years off the previous MPB) so I load them up for the long haul. Plus I might try doing a bit of video/pods in the next year (narrator: He would not). I've had Windows and Linux but I prefer Apple stuff for longevity and some basic set-it-and-forget-it stuff.

**Keyboard** - I have a [WASD CODE](https://www.wasdkeyboards.com/code-v3-87-key-mechanical-keyboard-cherry-mx-blue.html) clicky/mechanical keyboard. I like it well enough, but it's not a religious experience for me as it is for some. I have MX Cherry Brown (softer, quieter - I used to work in a shared office you monsters).

~~**Trackpad** - I have an Apple Magic Trackpad. I don't notice it and I don't seem to get wrist pains, which is all I ask of it.~~

I have moved over to a [Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac](https://www.logitech.com/en-kw/products/mice/mx-master-3-mac-wireless-mouse.910-005696.html) that I swiped from herself after she moved up to a verticle style mouse. It does everything I ask it to.

**Monitor** - I have a couple Dell U2713h that I've never loved and hope they die soon so I can ask for something +4k to spare my old eyes. They don't play nice with my new MBP (or vice versa).

**Desk** - I have a simple wood desktop from Ikea bolted to some motorized sit/stand desk. I wish I could say I stood a lot.

**Chair** - I sit on a refurbished Aeron that is fine. If it broke I would try something else. I had about 2 hours to find a chair before the world shut down for a month and this is what I ended up with.

**Laptop Stand** - I have a [Roost](https://www.therooststand.com/) that I very much enjoy. It folds up nice for portability and it keeps the laptop up fairly high. Pricy but if you use it 8 hours a day...

**Headphones** - I have some [Bose Q35](https://www.bose.com/en_us/products/headphones/over_ear_headphones/quietcomfort-35-wireless-ii.html#v=qc35_ii_black) over my ears most of the day. Again, overpriced (I didn't pay for them), but if you work in a open office (or at home during a pandemic) and are easily distracted, can you put on price on them? I wish the ear-pads were tougher.

**Phone** - I currently have a iPhone15 Pro that I will keep for 3 or 4 years and then get whatever the current model is. I am kind of indifferent to a phone as long as it works. A good camera is nice, but I don't know what to do with it, so.

**Eyeglasses** - I have marginal eyesight, but I hate wearing readers at a computer because they rest of the world become blurry. Ray-Ban makes some "[computer glasses](https://www.readingglasses.com/ray-ban/?searchinput=computer)" that are more magnified at the bottom of the lense (less at top) which seem to work well for my situation. I can look away from the screen and still see things.

## SOFTWARE

**Text-editor:** Shocker, I use [VS-Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I tend to just use whatever everybody else is using because any questions I have will be robustly answered in StackOverFlow and any extensions I need will exist. I will say this is probably the longest I've ever been on one editor (I was on TextMate for a long while too).

*Extensions*
- [Atom One Light Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=akamud.vscode-theme-onelight) I tend to do better with light themes. I don't look like a hacker, but I can see it.
- [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker) I no do words good.
- [Highlight Matching Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag) I no do tabs/indents good.
- [HTML End Tag Labels](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anteprimorac.html-end-tag-labels) One of my favorites. It puts a comment on the closing tag to tell you what div it is closing. So helpful.
- [Markdown Shortcuts](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mdickin.markdown-shortcuts) It's kind of like Emmet for markdown. 
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatter, you already use this probably.

**Graphics Editor** I have a full Adobe install, that I despise, through work, so I tend to use that. Bonus, if my furnace quits I just fire up 3 Adobe apps and my laptop will heat the entire office. I have used Sketch and Figma when I've worked with designers who use them. They all confuse me. In times of desperation I will turn to GIMP.

**Password Manager** [1Password](https://1password.com/). First thing I install on a computer/device. But each time I update it, it seems to work less great. Which is not great.

**Browsers** For development I use [FireFox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). I like to support Mozilla and I like their inspector. Chrome is on my machine for testing (Lighthouse), but I just feel like I'm being spied on. I use Safari for personal stuff because I can bounce between my phone and laptop easily. 

*Extensions*
- [Fonts Ninja](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fonts-ninja/) because I no do fonts well.
- [Wappalyzer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wappalyzer/) So I can see what you are building your site with.
- [AXE](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/) So I can see if what you are building is accessible.
- [Web Developer Toolbar](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/) A classic. Still go to this often.

**Email** Deep breath. Because my employer is a Microsoft [ed] shop, I must use Office and Exchange. While you can use almost any email client with Exchange, none of them work super great. The one that works best for me is...Outlook for Web. I know I know. Since I don't love email as a part of my browser, I sandbox it into a container app (~~I used [Flotato](https://www.flotato.com/) last time~~ I use Safari Web Apps). So now the web view works like a native app. Kind of. Email sucks and this is the best system I've come up with so far.

**Task Management** As mentioned above, my org tends to use MSFT Planner for project planning. I also use MSFT *To Do* and don't activily hate it. The "My Day" feature is nice and I can turn emails into tasks that refer back to the email. If I have it open inside of out Outlook Calendar, I can drag/drop tasks onto my calender to schedule time to work on it. In general, because I have serious focus issues, I try and practice "[1 Item To Do Lists](https://hbr.org/2020/08/your-to-do-list-is-in-fact-too-long)."

I use Slack, Github and Terminal like any other good little dev. I have to use MSFT Teams and Planner, but I can't say I love it. But we get them for free, and we get support with it, so.

## STACK(s)

New big sites are built in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/).
Old big sites were built in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) .

New small sites are built in [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/).
Old small sites were built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Code is hosted on [github](https://github.com/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
Content is edited via Netlify-CMS and, preferably, [Forestry.io](https://www.forestry.io/).

We use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) a lot for front-end stuff. Just stop. Stop what you are about to say. If it's ok for me to run 400 libraries and frameworks on the backend of the stack, I don't see why I can't run bootstrap on the frontend. Shhhh. Yes, we customize it. Shhhhhh.
