<p>Like <a href="https://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/weaknotes">Alice</a>, <a href="https://danmall.com/weeknotes/2021-05-23/">Dan</a>, and <a href="https://www.builtwith.coffee/blog/1">Joe</a>, I'm would like to make this a thing.</p>
<p>###[Computers]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Built a <a href="https://www.11ty.dev">11ty</a> site with a <a href="https://forestry.io">Forestry.io</a> backend. So far I'm happy with the improvements from using <a href="https://www.netlifycms.org">Netlify CMS</a> (not <a href="https://www.netlify.com">netlify</a> the deployment service, which is one of the most brilliant products released in the last decade. Creating a custom content type, and adding an editor was pretty painless. I've been using Jekyll for almost a decade, but keeping a ruby stack running along side my javascript stuff has gotten to be too much of an ass-ache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched some of <a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/home">Build 2021</a>, Microsoft's developer conference. We are, of course, very post-the-time-things-made-any-sense, but it still feels weird the Microsoft is eating everybody's lunch when it comes to supporting a development community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tried to build something that seems doable in <a href="https://public.tableau.com/s/">Tableau Public</a>, but so far it's Fail City, might take another shot at it this week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>###[Home Life]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting W some home with his social/emotional skills. This has been an unkind year for him.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planted some grass. I hate landscaping and abhor competing with neighbors, but my yards is just a pile of dirt where chipmunks dwell. I went with with a hardy grass that has clover mixed in. Clover is not in style this century, but it appeals to me in that: it grows, it's green, and when you mow it, the clippings are nitrate (food) for the grass it is mixed in with.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>###[Consumed]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finished season 2 of &quot;For All Mankind.&quot; Herself and I are both really into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watch the first few episodes of Season 2 of Mythic Quest. I really really loved the two eps they did while in quarantine, but this season is really drilling down on how flawed the characters are. Much more of a &quot;Always Sunny&quot; vibe, which doesn't really fit with what I want right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Watched &quot;Master of None&quot; Season 3. Very very different from the first two seasons. It was well done, but removing the Dev character was pretty predictable way to handle Aziz's own fall from grace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
