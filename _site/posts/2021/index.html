<hr>
I've had worse years (actually just one, and it was last year), but I'm glad to be done with this year.  I'm sure my year was roughly like yours. I wish I was somebody who achieved crazy goals during all this time at home, but I'm more just trying to help keep all of our family's heads above water. I like the fact that I can be more present with my family. I do miss going to Boston and seeing my work chums. Consistent fitness remains illusive, and some of my larger goals are still years off schedule.
<p>Here are some highlights, in no particular order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarted my personal website(RIP jetsetbingo)</li>
<li>Kids went back to school</li>
<li>Sorta kinda got better at living day-to-day in a pandemic</li>
<li>Paid off the other car</li>
<li>tore out the old busted gas fireplace insert (my FIL drywalled like an ace)</li>
<li>Got a new mountain bike and <em>sent it</em> (with the appropriate caution of a mid 40's dad)</li>
<li>Got the kids started with skiing and they <em>sent it</em> (did a bit more myself)</li>
<li>Hit a few pub runs and did a 5k</li>
<li>Had some heat pumps (mini splits to some) installed - they are great, make the house much warmer</li>
<li>Saw my folks and travelled to VA to see my sister.</li>
<li>Family trip to VT and Niagara Falls.</li>
<li>Took the kids to NYC for the first time. They were entertained for about 45 minutes.</li>
<li>Gave the kids decent pandemic birthdays (we are getting better at this)</li>
<li>Travelled to Kingdom Trails/VT for Noel's annual birthday MTB trip</li>
<li>Started drinking more bourbon (I guess that is a highlight, I may look back and regret this)</li>
<li>Got W more help with his disability/ability issues.</li>
<li>Started coaching R's hoops team (I love basketball and love helping kids get better at it)</li>
<li>Got a new dev machine up and running (got 7 years out of my old MBP)</li>
<li>Continued to read a decent amount of books per year (I was previously not an avid reader)</li>
<li>Continued to connect with a nice peer group of devs via our slack group</li>
<li>Played <em>a lot</em> of fortnite with nice peer group of devs (and by myself).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="goals-for-2022">Goals for 2022 <a class="direct-link" href="#goals-for-2022">#</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Find some sort of fitness I enjoy. I've never just worked out for it's own sake. I should try and find an activity I like doing. I'm sure this will go great</li>
<li>Grow this site: I want to document things I do, learn, and read</li>
<li>Find ways to relax that won't destroy my mind/body</li>
<li>Renew some expired certs</li>
<li>Do some camping</li>
<li>Send it on my bike/skis</li>
<li>Head back to Ireland for a spell?</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's hoping 2022 isn't another bag of face-chewing rats!</p>
